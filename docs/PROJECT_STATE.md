# ICT Trading Cockpit — Current Project State

**Last handoff update:** 2026-10-07

This is the starting point for a new development chat or developer handoff. Git remains the source of truth for code; this file records the verified project checkpoint and the reasoning context needed to continue without reconstructing chat history.

## Repository state

- **Current branch:** `main`
- **Competency / Proficiency v0 merge:** `98266e5f6423f91484d1ff687795f6f1b829220a` — PR #26
- **Smoke-test runner v0 merge:** `2356240fb0cd5749682e49b1f9895fe919ab8af4` — PR #27
- **Current slice:** none open; ready to select the next roadmap slice
- **Schema:** v26
- **Trade Plan revision:** Alpha 0.7
- **Verified full test result:** **272 passed** (268 prior baseline + 4 smoke-test document unit tests; user confirmed full suite green)
- **Manual smoke test:** smoke-test runner v0 acceptance PASS — load/edit/save/reopen works, and Git diff showed only the intended selected change.

## Current completed slice — Competency / Proficiency substrate v0

Implemented/established in this slice:

- plan-owned competency definitions,
- competency/profile persistence,
- Study Run focus links,
- competency assessment tracking/schema support,
- mentorship Trade Plan competency coverage/tests,
- deterministic Replay context for tests that exercise timed Live Watch behavior.

The first practical competency loop is:

Trade Plan competency catalog
→ current proficiency state
→ Study Run focus links
→ future evidence against the competency

Historical Backtest / Study is therefore able to identify which plan-owned mechanics it is training and preserve that association for later Review. Replay and Forward Test can also preserve competency-only run intent when the optional Focus/question is blank.

## Accepted architecture

### Environment ladder

- Historical Backtest / Lab → **Study**
- Replay → **Rehearsal**
- Forward Test → **Validation**
- Live → **Execution**

Progression eligibility remains separate from these semantic labels.

### Competency ownership and evidence

- Competency **definitions** belong to the versioned Trade Plan.
- Competency **state** is separate mutable profile data.
- Competency **evidence** is separate from both the definition and state.
- Changing the authoritative competency catalog requires a new published plan revision.

See `docs/DECISIONS.md` for rationale.

## Intentionally deferred

Do not assume these exist merely because the competency substrate exists:

- proficiency percentages or readiness scores,
- automatic promotion/demotion,
- automatic Live eligibility lock based on proficiency,
- fixed proficiency thresholds,
- a large competency/proficiency dashboard.

These require evidence/threshold rules that have not yet been justified.

## Test-history clarification

An earlier run on this branch collected 267 tests and reported **265 passed / 2 failed** in `tests/test_structured_playbook.py`.

Those failures were time-context dependent. Pulling through implementation commit `9fa5807` changed the affected structured-playbook tests to deterministic Replay runs; the subsequent full suite was **267 passed**. Do not carry the earlier result forward as an unresolved Live Watch production regression.

## Manual acceptance status

Current operator checks completed on 2026-10-07:

- non-Live environments expose the expected five competency focus checkboxes,
- competency focus selections persist into Post-Market Review,
- competency focus selections persist after application restart as part of the Trading Run,
- launcher checkbox selections do not repopulate after restart; this is expected because the launcher represents a new run while persisted Study Context belongs to the started/restored run,
- Post-Market Review reopening at Market Review stage 1 rather than the previously viewed stage 2 is accepted transient UI behavior,
- smoke testing exposed a Replay/Forward defect where competency-only intent was discarded when the optional question was blank,
- that defect was fixed and manually re-verified in both Replay and Forward Test,
- the full automated suite after the fix is 268 passed.

See `docs/SMOKE_TEST.md` for the completed acceptance record and repeatable checklist.

## Recently completed

### Competency / Proficiency substrate v0 — merged via PR #26

- plan-owned competency definitions,
- mutable competency/profile persistence kept separate from definitions,
- Study / Replay / Forward competency-focus provenance,
- competency focus preserved into Review and restart persistence,
- deterministic Replay context for time-aware tests,
- manual smoke-test acceptance complete.

### Developer smoke-test runner v0 — merged via PR #27

- PySide6 runner for `docs/SMOKE_TEST.md`,
- PASS / FAIL / QUESTION / NOT TESTED controls,
- per-item comments/evidence,
- previous/next and next-unresolved navigation,
- live acceptance summary,
- save-back to Markdown,
- Markdown round-trip unit tests,
- manually verified that edits persist and only intended Markdown changes appear in Git diff.

The runner remains a convenience layer over Markdown, not a second acceptance-data format.

## Current task

No feature branch is open. Start the next isolated roadmap slice from current `main` after selecting the highest-value item based on observed workflow friction and the established roadmap.

Do not expand the smoke-test runner unless repeated use exposes concrete friction. Do not introduce competency thresholds/readiness scoring until evidence rules justify them.

## Continuity protocol

For every substantial feature slice, update this file before the slice is considered complete.

At minimum update:

- branch,
- implementation baseline SHA/message,
- test count/status,
- schema,
- Trade Plan revision,
- completed work,
- current task,
- unresolved issues,
- intentionally deferred behavior.

Append durable design decisions to `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

See `docs/HANDOFF.md` for the complete handoff procedure.
