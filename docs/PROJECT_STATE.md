# ICT Trading Cockpit — Current Project State

**Last handoff update:** 2026-10-08

This is the starting point for a new development chat or developer handoff. Git remains the source of truth for code; this file records the verified project checkpoint and the reasoning context needed to continue without reconstructing chat history.

## Repository state

- **Active branch:** `feature/competency-evidence-v0`
- **Main baseline:** `c243074c4a204ca1e91fa84e15b2844442747c58` — PR #29 merged roadmap reconciliation / hardened handoff
- **Competency / Proficiency v0 merge:** `98266e5f6423f91484d1ff687795f6f1b829220a` — PR #26
- **Smoke-test runner v0 merge:** `2356240fb0cd5749682e49b1f9895fe919ab8af4` — PR #27
- **Current slice:** Milestone A — competency evidence loop v0
- **Schema:** v28
- **Trade Plan revision:** Alpha 0.7
- **Last verified full test result:** **278 passed** on the v27 baseline; v28 competency-evidence branch awaiting local validation
- **Manual smoke test:** configurable summary templates v0 acceptance PASS — both template kinds publish/use new revisions, persistence survives restart, generated outputs show template provenance, and invalid fields are rejected.

## Current completed slice — Competency / Proficiency substrate v0

Implemented/established in this slice:

- plan-owned competency definitions,
- competency/profile persistence,
- Study Run focus links,
- competency assessment tracking/schema support,
- mentorship Trade Plan competency coverage/tests,
- deterministic Replay context for tests that exercise timed Live Watch behavior.

The first practical competency loop is:

Trade Plan competency catalog
→ current proficiency state
→ Study Run focus links
→ future evidence against the competency

Historical Backtest / Study is therefore able to identify which plan-owned mechanics it is training and preserve that association for later Review. Replay and Forward Test can also preserve competency-only run intent when the optional Focus/question is blank.

## Accepted architecture

### Environment ladder

- Historical Backtest / Lab → **Study**
- Replay → **Rehearsal**
- Forward Test → **Validation**
- Live → **Execution**

Progression eligibility remains separate from these semantic labels.

### Competency ownership and evidence

- Competency **definitions** belong to the versioned Trade Plan.
- Competency **state** is separate mutable profile data.
- Competency **evidence** is separate from both the definition and state.
- Changing the authoritative competency catalog requires a new published plan revision.

See `docs/DECISIONS.md` for rationale.

## Intentionally deferred

Do not assume these exist merely because the competency substrate exists:

- proficiency percentages or readiness scores,
- automatic promotion/demotion,
- automatic Live eligibility lock based on proficiency,
- fixed proficiency thresholds,
- a large competency/proficiency dashboard.

These require evidence/threshold rules that have not yet been justified.

## Test-history clarification

An earlier run on this branch collected 267 tests and reported **265 passed / 2 failed** in `tests/test_structured_playbook.py`.

Those failures were time-context dependent. Pulling through implementation commit `9fa5807` changed the affected structured-playbook tests to deterministic Replay runs; the subsequent full suite was **267 passed**. Do not carry the earlier result forward as an unresolved Live Watch production regression.

## Manual acceptance status

Current operator checks completed on 2026-10-07:

- non-Live environments expose the expected five competency focus checkboxes,
- competency focus selections persist into Post-Market Review,
- competency focus selections persist after application restart as part of the Trading Run,
- launcher checkbox selections do not repopulate after restart; this is expected because the launcher represents a new run while persisted Study Context belongs to the started/restored run,
- Post-Market Review reopening at Market Review stage 1 rather than the previously viewed stage 2 is accepted transient UI behavior,
- smoke testing exposed a Replay/Forward defect where competency-only intent was discarded when the optional question was blank,
- that defect was fixed and manually re-verified in both Replay and Forward Test,
- the full automated suite after the fix is 268 passed.

See `docs/SMOKE_TEST.md` for the completed acceptance record and repeatable checklist.

## Recently completed

### Competency / Proficiency substrate v0 — merged via PR #26

- plan-owned competency definitions,
- mutable competency/profile persistence kept separate from definitions,
- Study / Replay / Forward competency-focus provenance,
- competency focus preserved into Review and restart persistence,
- deterministic Replay context for time-aware tests,
- manual smoke-test acceptance complete.

### Developer smoke-test runner v0 — merged via PR #27

- PySide6 runner for `docs/SMOKE_TEST.md`,
- PASS / FAIL / QUESTION / NOT TESTED controls,
- per-item comments/evidence,
- previous/next and next-unresolved navigation,
- live acceptance summary,
- save-back to Markdown,
- Markdown round-trip unit tests,
- manually verified that edits persist and only intended Markdown changes appear in Git diff.

The runner remains a convenience layer over Markdown, not a second acceptance-data format.

## Current architectural frontier

The recovered development trajectory is now explicit:

`targeted Study -> competency evidence -> Replay integration -> Forward validation -> progression/eligibility -> Live Execution`

Competency / Proficiency v0 is complete. The project had already deliberately shifted away from additional Live-Watch embellishment toward the Study/Lab learning and progression loop.

Review / Development synthesis and an Evidence Maturity Profile remain important future consumers/governors, but they should be built only after the competency-evidence substrate is trustworthy.

Older Film Night, responsive-gallery, visual-polish, broad TradingView-integration, hardware-controller, and Live-Watch enhancement discussions are downstream ideas unless actual use makes one blocking.

## Current task

Milestone A has started on `feature/competency-evidence-v0`.

The first vertical slice intentionally reuses the existing Study Review rather than introducing a new scoring UI.

Implemented for validation:

- new first-class `CompetencyEvidence` record separate from competency definition and mutable competency state,
- schema v28 `competency_evidence` storage,
- one evidence row per reviewed Trading Run + focused competency,
- evidence snapshots Trade Plan revision, environment/purpose, Study question/hypothesis/scope/outcome/note, competency name/category, market-time context, and QT context,
- evidence identity remains stable for the same run + competency,
- re-review replaces the current run evidence instead of accumulating duplicate rows,
- MainWindow synchronization automatically materializes reviewed Study/Rehearsal/Validation competency focus into evidence when the Trading Run is saved,
- retrieval by run and by competency,
- regression tests for schema, the Study Review -> persisted evidence path, and re-review behavior.

Deliberately **not** included:

- competency scores,
- automatic competency-state changes,
- promotion/demotion,
- eligibility changes,
- evidence weighting,
- evidence-maturity thresholds,
- a new evidence dashboard.

Next action: run the full automated suite locally. If green, manually exercise one focused Historical Backtest/Study review and confirm no visible workflow regression. Then inspect the evidence model before deciding whether this minimal evidence shape is accepted or needs adjustment.

## Continuity protocol

For every substantial feature slice, update this file before the slice is considered complete.

At minimum update:

- branch,
- implementation baseline SHA/message,
- test count/status,
- schema,
- Trade Plan revision,
- completed work,
- current task,
- unresolved issues,
- intentionally deferred behavior.

Append durable design decisions to `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

See `docs/HANDOFF.md` for the complete handoff procedure.
